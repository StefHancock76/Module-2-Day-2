//Write JS code that solve the following problems
//Q1. Using an if-else statement, determine if a number is divisible by 3, by 5, or both.

let q1test = 15;
for(q1test=1;q1test<=100;q1test++){
  if(q1test%3==0 || q1test%5==0){
    console.log(q1test)
  }
}

//Add code here

//Q2. Using an if-else statement, determin is a year is a leap year or not.
//Research what are the conditions to be considered a leap year. "To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not. 2024, 2028, 2032 and 2036 are all leap years."

let year = 1999;
// let year = 2000;
// let year = 1900;
// let year = 2024;

//Add code here

//Q3. Use a loop to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 or 4.
