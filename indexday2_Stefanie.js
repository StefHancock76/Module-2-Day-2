//Write JS code that solve the following problems
//Q1. Using an if-else statement, determine if a number is divisible by 3, by 5, or both.

let q1test = 15;

if (q1test / 3 || 5) {
    q1test = "true"
} else {
    q1test = "false"
}
console.log(q1test);


//Q2. Using an if-else statement, determin is a year is a leap year or not.
//Research what are the "To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not. 2024, 2028, 2032 and 2036 are all leap years.".

let year = 1999;
// let year = 2000;
// let year = 1900;
// let year = 2024;
